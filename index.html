<p>You can find my Fast-AI Learning blog <a href="https://build3r.github.io/fastai" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/build3r/TodayILearned/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Today I Learned</a></h3>
<p> I maintain a simple file to list all the things I learn which don't require a full blog post <a href="https://github.com/build3r/TodayILearned/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">here</a>. The goal is to learn at least one topic a day.</p>
